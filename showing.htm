					<p class="copy"> 
					If you're in the Ann Arbor area, you've probably 
					heard of Rich Sheridan and his amazing software 
					factory Menlo Innovations. Rich is a man of 
					extraordinary character and kindness, and when 
					we were trying to get our own start-up going, 
					Rich agreed to mentor us. When we showed Rich 
					the video we had made, he liked it so much he 
					asked us to do one (or three =D) for Menlo. We 
					really excited to be working for a company that 
					makes such cool software.</p>

					<p class="copy">
					So we started poking around Menlo's site to see 
					how they were using the web to tell their story. 
					The Menlo we knew came mostly from hearing Rich 
					tell his favorite anecdotes about clients and staff. 
					His stories were some of the best parts of our time 
					together. Alas! There was hardly a trace of Rich's 
					magic anywhere to be found on Menlo's site! More 
					people needed to see what Menlo was really all about, 
					and they needed to hear it from Rich! But Rich is 
					only one man with only so much time. Our mission 
					was clear: choose the best Menlo stories, narrated 
					by Rich, and bring them to life! </p>
					
					<p class="copy">
					With these videos, it's a lot easier for all of us 
					to share little pieces of Rich. We love these stories 
					because they encapsulate the essence of Menlo. These 
					are the ones that stick with you; that you re-tell to others. </p>

					<h3 class="prepend-top append-bottom">Let Us Find Your Magic.</h3>
					
					<p class="copy"> Or better yet, let us tell stories 
					about your client's successes. That's the real secret.</p>
					
					<p class="copy"> 
					When you're in the trenches, fighting to build a 
					successful company, often times it becomes hard to 
					see the forest from the trees. We know, we've been there; 
					but that's why we're here, to help you lose the MBA-speak 
					and tell your story so it sounds like there's actually 
					a human being behind it. Send us an email. We'd love to 
					hear about what you're working on and just maybe we can help.</p>
