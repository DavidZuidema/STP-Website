				<p>Sneaky Tiki Productions was started by David Zuidema and Jon Carender in Ann Arbor, MI. We make web videos for companies with really cool products or services.</p>
				<h1>Stop Telling, Start Showing</h1>
				<p>Adding a video to your website is a great, low-risk way for potential  customers to go beyond the standard list of <span class="emphasis">features 'n benefits</span> and actually test drive a story about how your product fits into their lives. A video allows you to show your customers what you can do for them, not just tell them how great you are. </p>
				<h1>Entrepreneurs On A Mission (Our Story)</h1>
				<p>When we were building our startup company, we needed to get our message out to a lot of people, but with only two founders, we were limited by how many meetings we could schedule each week. In an age of social media, it should be easy (and cheap) for us to spread our message far and wide. Many iterations of awesome email copy and really pretty powerpoint slides later, no one was paying any attention to us. Our medium was too boring and static to hold anyone's attention. So how can we be as engaging as we are in person, but as easy to share as a YouTube video? Wait, that's it! A YouTube video! </p>
				<p>With a video we can tell a consistent story and make it easy for anyone to share.</p>
				<p>So first, we looked at hiring someone else to make our video for us. Working on a startup's budget, full scale production companies and animation studios were WAAAY out of our price range. We stumbled upon other smaller freelancers like <a href="http://demogirl.com/">DemoGirl</a>, but their videos were really just glorified feature lists. We needed someone to tell our <span class="emphasis">story</span>—might as well be us.</p>
				<p>Next, we refined our message by studying the works of marketing gurus, mostly <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a>. We augmented our existing design skills by learning how to animate and produced our first video for ProjectClarity:</p>

				<h1>Rich's Anecdotes</h1>
				<p>If you're in the Ann Arbor area, you've probably heard of Rich Sheridan and his amazing software factory <a href="http://www.menloinnovations.com">Menlo Innovations</a>. Rich is a man of extraordinary character and kindness and when we were trying to get our own start-up going, Rich agreed to mentor us. When we showed Rich the video we made, he liked it so much he asked us to do one  for Menlo (So we made him three, haha). We were really excited to be working for a company that makes such cool software.</p>
				<p>We started poking around Menlo's site to see how they were using the web to tell their story. The Menlo we knew came mostly from hearing Rich  tell his favorite anecdotes about clients and staff. His stories were some of the best parts of our time together. Alas! There was hardly a trace of Rich's magic anywhere to be found on Menlo's site! More people needed to hear about Menlo and they needed to hear it from Rich! But Rich is only one man with so much time. Our mission was clear: sift through hours of talks Rich has given to find the best Menlo stories  and bring them to life with animated characters.</p>
				<object width="640" height="360" class="video"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=12544658&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=0&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00adef&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=12544658&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=0&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00adef&amp;fullscreen=1" width="640" height="360" vspace="20" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always"></embed></object>
				<p>With these videos, it's a lot easier for all of us to share little pieces of Rich. We love these stories because they really encapsulate the essence of Menlo. These are the ones that stick with you; that you re-tell to others.    </p>
				<h1>Let Us Tell Your Story</h1>
				<p>Or better yet, let us tell stories about your client's successes. That's the real secret.</p>
				<p>When you're in the trenches, fighting to build a successful company, often times it becomes hard to see the forest from the trees. We know, we've been there. That's why we're here, to help you lose the MBA-speak and tell your story so it sounds like there's actually a human being behind it. (There is.) Send us an email. We'd love to hear about what you're working on and  maybe we can help.</p>
